## Why Another covid tracker?

Initially I was called by a friend who was developing a covid tracker and called me to help out with the mapbox api. <br>
Once I had finished it I worked on solving other issues the website had and eventually everyone stopped working on the project. <br>
I then thought I want to do something different with the app and to make it more useful. I also wanted to learn how to display the data in different ways. <br>
And what is the harm that one more covid tracker will do.

## Future Plans

I don't intent to work on this project anymore as of right now, apart for some minor bug issues.
